best_practices:
  file_size:
    - "Keep under 100KB (critical!)"
    - "Under 50KB ideal for mobile"
    - "Reduce colors (128 or less)"
    - "Lower FPS (10-12)"
    - "Short duration (1-3s)"

  animation:
    - "Subtle is professional"
    - "Avoid distracting loops"
    - "Fade-in or gentle pulse best"
    - "Test in actual email clients"

  design:
    - "High contrast for visibility"
    - "Simple, clear design"
    - "Readable at small sizes"
    - "Brand-consistent colors"

  technical:
    - "Provide static fallback (first frame)"
    - "Test in Outlook (often shows static)"
    - "Alt text for accessibility"
    - "Link to relevant page"

email_signature_html:
  example: |
    <a href="https://example.com">
      <img src="https://example.com/signature.gif"
           alt="Company Logo"
           width="150"
           height="50"
           style="border:0; display:block;" />
    </a>

common_mistakes:
  file_too_large:
    problem: "GIF doesn't load or blocks email delivery"
    solution: "Reduce to <100KB, use fewer colors, lower FPS"

  too_distracting:
    problem: "Unprofessional, annoying animation"
    solution: "Use subtle fade-in or gentle pulse only"

  not_mobile_friendly:
    problem: "Too large or doesn't work on mobile"
    solution: "Keep under 50KB, test on mobile clients"

  outlook_static:
    problem: "Animated in Gmail but static in Outlook"
    solution: "Ensure first frame looks good (it's the fallback)"

  blocked_by_firewall:
    problem: "Corporate emails block external images"
    solution: "Can't fix, but keep file small to improve delivery"

testing_checklist:
  - "Send test email to yourself"
  - "Check in Gmail (web and mobile)"
  - "Check in Outlook (desktop and web)"
  - "Check in Apple Mail"
  - "Verify file size < 100KB"
  - "Confirm animation is subtle"
  - "Check static fallback (first frame)"
  - "Test on phone"
