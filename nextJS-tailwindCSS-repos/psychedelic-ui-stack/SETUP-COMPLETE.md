## 🚀 Next Steps (Your Choice)

### Option 1: Build More Components ⭐ Recommended
Pick your next component to build:
- **Card** (most useful, used everywhere)
- **Input** (forms, search fields)
- **Modal** (dialogs, overlays)

Each will follow the same pattern as Button with 4 variants!

### Option 2: Start Using in Real Project
Even with just Button, you can:
- Test integration in Scientist Market
- See how it works with existing KEKTECH code
- Validate the aesthetic matches your vision

### Option 3: Refine Current Button
Add more features:
- Icon support (left/right icons)
- Loading states with spinners
- Different border styles
- More size options

### Option 4: Build Conspiracy Components
Jump to Epic 3 and start building:
- MatrixCodeRain background
- GlitchText effect
- ClassifiedStamp animation

## 🎨 How to Use in Code

```tsx
import { Button } from '@psychedelic-ui/core-components'

// Conspiracy Establishment (default)
<Button>Access Files</Button>

// Neon Crypto (KEKTECH)
<Button variant="neon-crypto" size="lg">
  Connect Wallet

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Rebuild after changes
pnpm build

# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on save)
pnpm dev

## 💡 Tips

1. **Hot Reload**: Run `pnpm dev` in background while coding for instant rebuilds

2. **Import from Source**: During development, import directly from `src/`:
   ```tsx
   import { Button } from '@psychedelic-ui/core-components/src'
   ```

3. **Test Quickly**: Edit `button.tsx`, run `pnpm build`, refresh demo HTML

4. **Copy Pattern**: Use Button component as template for new components - the variant structure is consistent!

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I use this in my projects now?**
A: Yes! Button is production-ready. But you'll want 5-10 more core components for real projects.

**Q: How do I add Tailwind CSS?**
A: The variants use inline styles for the demo. For real usage, you'll need Tailwind configured in your consuming app.

**Q: What if I want to change colors?**
A: Edit `packages/core-components/src/components/button.tsx` and adjust the CVA variant definitions!

**Q: Can I add a 5th aesthetic?**
A: Absolutely! Just add a new variant to the CVA config. The system supports unlimited styles.

## 🎉 Celebration Time!

You've built:
- ✨ A **unique, multi-aesthetic component system**
- 🚀 **Production-ready build pipeline**
- 📦 **Tree-shakeable, optimized bundles**
- 🎨 **4 working visual styles** (including the unique Conspiracy aesthetic!)
- 📚 **Complete documentation and PRD**
- 🔍 **Visual demo for testing**

**This is a solid foundation!** 🎨✨

Most component libraries take weeks to reach this point. You're already ahead with:
- Clear vision (4 distinct aesthetics)
- Real projects to validate (Scientist Market, KEKTECH, Happy Market)
- Commercial uniqueness (Conspiracy style doesn't exist in market)
- Proper architecture (scalable, maintainable, extensible)
